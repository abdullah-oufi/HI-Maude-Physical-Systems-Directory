--- Discrete train example

(tmod DISCRETE-TRAIN is protecting NAT-TIME-DOMAIN .
	sort TrainState .
	
	op move : -> TrainState [ctor] .
	op train : TrainState Nat -> System [ctor] .

	var N : Time .

	crl [travel] : {train(move,N)} => 
	  {train(move,N + 1)} in time 1 if N < 500 .

	rl [reset] : {train(move,500)} => {train(move,0)} .
endtm)


--- Timed rewrite simulation on train
(trew {train(move,0)} in time <= 100 .)
